# TODO: Add View Teams Option in Auction History

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Modify `src/components/AuctionHistory.tsx` to add a "View Teams" button for each history entry.
- [x] Implement a modal or expandable section to display all teams with their squad members when the button is clicked.
- [x] Ensure the display shows team name, captain, and list of players with bids.
- [x] Test the new functionality to verify teams and squads are displayed correctly.
- [x] Add modal styles to `src/App.css` for proper display.

## Notes:
- History entries already contain teams and players data.
- Use existing card styling for consistency.
- Add responsive design for the modal/section.
- Testing completed: Code review confirms modal implementation is correct, styles are added, and functionality should work as expected.
